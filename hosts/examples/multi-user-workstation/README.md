## Customization Guide

### 1. User Setup
Add your team members to the configuration:

```nix
# Add team members
users.users.alice = {
  home = "/Users/alice";
  description = "Alice Johnson - Backend Developer";
};

users.users.bob = {
  home = "/Users/bob";
  description = "Bob Smith - Frontend Developer";
};

users.users.charlie = {
  home = "/Users/charlie";
  description = "Charlie Brown - DevOps Engineer";
};
```

### 2. Team-Specific Tools
Customize tools based on your team's technology stack:

```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  # Your team's primary languages
  nodejs          # If doing web development
  python3         # If using Python
  go              # If using Go
  
  # Your team's databases
  postgresql      # If using PostgreSQL
  redis           # If using Redis
  
  # Your team's cloud platform
  awscli          # If using AWS
  # azure-cli     # If using Azure
  # google-cloud-sdk  # If using GCP
];
```

### 3. Collaboration Applications
Add team-specific collaboration tools:

```nix
homebrew.casks = [
  # Your team's communication tools
  "slack"                    # If using Slack
  "microsoft-teams"          # If using Teams
  "discord"                  # If using Discord
  
  # Your team's design tools
  "figma"                    # If doing design work
  "sketch"                   # Alternative design tool
  
  # Your team's project management
  "notion"                   # If using Notion
  "jira"                     # If using Jira
];
```

### 4. Security Configuration
Adjust security settings for your environment:

```nix
# Enhanced security for shared environment
system.defaults.loginwindow = {
  GuestEnabled = false;              # No guest access
  SHOWFULLNAME = true;               # Show user names
  DisableConsoleAccess = true;       # Enhanced security
};

# Require password after screensaver
system.defaults.CustomUserPreferences."com.apple.screensaver" = {
  askForPassword = 1;
  askForPasswordDelay = 300;         # 5 minutes
};
```
